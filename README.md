# Apriori Algorithm
This project contains a naive implementation of the Apriori algorithm. The project is
built and compiled with cmake:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mads-hb/apriori-cpp.git
cd apriori-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

The project is based on an anonymous Belgian retail data set that is described
